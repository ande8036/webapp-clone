    This project is a working single page application to help illustrate crimes in St. Paul, Minnesota.
    It implements 3 different APIs: Leaflet, Nominatim, and our own custom API. 
    Leaflet: used to render interactive maps that have the ability to have markers and other data imposed on the map. 
    Nominatim: allows for quick searching of a location by its name or to grab a location's address based on its latitude/longitude 
    Our API: custom made API that allows easy retrieval of St. Paul crime incidents based on police code, location, time, and a few other criteria.
    This project also utilizes Vue.js for the implementation of the map</p><br><br>
