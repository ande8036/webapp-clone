--This README.md has been created for the purpose of being part of an e-portfolio. It doesn't actually have anything to do with this webapp.

  This application is a single page web application made for my Web Development course. It's purpose is to display crime data from a database onto an interactive map of St. Paul. The data can be filtered and shown in a large table. Data from the table can be added as a marker on the map. It accomplishes this by using the Leaflet API for the map display, The Nominatim API for searching for map locations, and an API made for a different assignment in the same class, which allows for a variety of GET requests to retrieve data from the database. We also color-coded crimes on the table to make them easily distinguishable. Crimes against people, violent crimes, were red. Crimes against property, like theft, were blue. All other crimes were tan. All these features combined allowed for easy visualization of crime in St Paul.
